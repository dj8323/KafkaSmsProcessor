Project Name: Kafka Data Consumer
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Dhananjay
Description: 
This project works as a consumer which fetches data from sources such as SMS Gateway and SMS Handler 
to update the delivery status (Delivered / Failed / Expired etc.) of any MSISDN which is already sent. 
The system updates the delivery status in the `gmat_log_info` table based on the `ref_Id` and source 
(camp / cvm / smpp).
